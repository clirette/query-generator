        <label for="tagline">Tagline</label>
        <p>Is there an exciting “catchphrase” that you can preface your story with? Something that can instantly pique the interest of your reader? Your book’s version of “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die…” If you don’t have a great tagline, don’t include one. A cheesy, generic tagline can be worse than no tagline at all.</p>
        <p><em>Ex. In the furthest bookcase, on the tallest shelf, a hidden world of magic awaits...</em></p>

        <h2>What am I supposed to do with this?</h2>
        <p>The query letter you’re looking at isn’t perfect, but hopefully it’s a useful starting point. While it hasn’t been done gracefully, it should have helped you identify the information you need for your query, and put it all in roughly the right shape.</p>
        <p>Now, it’s your turn to actually turn it into something good. The generator’s goal is to be applicable to as many stories as possible, so now you need to mold the query to your story and give it  your voice. Rework the hook into something more exciting. Move the setting information to the first paragraph.. Say “yours cordially” instead of “yours sincerely.” Add a second introductory paragraph to introduce your other narrator, because your story has two protagonist. Make it yours.</p>
        <p>This should result in a query on the shorter size of what’s acceptable (250-400 words), so feel free to expand it.</p>
        <p>For now, at least all of those elements are in the letter. Whether or not they’re in there <em>well</em>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>But I don’t know what I can change because I don’t know what “the rules” are?</h2>
        <p>Generally speaking, when editing your query, remember to:</p>
        <p><strong>Include the three mandatory sections: About the Book, Metadata, About Me.</strong> These are the three main things your query needs to do: Introduce your book in a way that will grab the reader’s attention, tell your reader where your book fits in “The Market,” and let your reader know who wrote the book. Hopefully the Query Generator has helped you with that.</p>
        <p><strong>Use business letter formatting.</strong> 12 point font. Single spaced. Left alignment. No indentations. A space between paragraphs.</p>
        <p><strong>Keep it short. 250-400 words.</strong> Remember your goal: to get the agent to pick up the first chapter. Agents can receive hundreds of queries in a week. They don’t have time for wasted words. They won’t wait for you to get to your point. Say what you have to say as quickly as possible</p>
        <p><strong>Not include themes.</strong> Don’t say this is a story about “friendship and the power or love,” or “children will relate to this story of bullying.” A query letter isn’t a literature class. Don’t analyse your manuscript for your reader. Let the story speak for itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Only name a few characters and locations outright.</strong> If you’re querying Harry Potter, you’ll want to use Harry’s name in the query, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Dursley can be “his cruel relatives.” Refer to things by their function in the manuscript and keep your query simple and easy to follow. The more names, locations, and special terms in your query, the more confusing it will be.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>And when I’m finished editing?</h2>
        <p>Congrats! Now here are some extra things to do before you send it off:</p>
        <p><strong>Have someone else look over your query before you send it out.</strong> Share it with the smartest person you know. An old English teacher. A writing website, like <a href="https://reddit.com/r/writers" target="_blank">r/writers</a>. Have them judge it on clarity and quality.</p>
        <p><strong>Use a site like QueryTracker or Manuscript Wishlist</strong> to make a list of agents to send your query out to.  Query Tracker will even help you track who your query has gone out to, how long it’s gone out, and how long it typically takes for that agent to respond.</p>
        <p><strong>Triple-check you’ve spelled the agents’ names correctly.</strong> While some are lenient about a mistake  this, others aren’t.  Don’t give them a reason to discount your query  in the first line.</p>
        <p><strong>Triple-check the agents’ submission requirements.</strong> Every agency will probably have slightly different requirements, so make sure you’re following the right directions.</p>
